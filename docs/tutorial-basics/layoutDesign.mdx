# Layout Design

Creating a web layout that is accessible, visually appealing, and responsive is essential. This guide will help you determine grid sizes and maximum container widths using Figma as your design reference.

## Steps to Determine Grid Size and Container Width

Follow these easy steps:

1. **Get the Canvas Size from Figma**: Find the width of your design canvas in Figma.
2. **Choose the Number of Grids**: Common choices are 12 or 16 grids.
3. **Calculate Grid Size**: Divide the canvas width by the number of grids.
4. **Set Maximum Container Size**: Use the grid size to determine the maximum width for your content.

### Example Calculation

Let's say your canvas size is 1440px and you want to use 12 grids:

- **Canvas Size**: 1440px
- **Number of Grids**: 12

To calculate the grid size:

```bash
Grid Size = Canvas Width / Number of Grids
Grid Size = 1440px / 12 = 120px

```
