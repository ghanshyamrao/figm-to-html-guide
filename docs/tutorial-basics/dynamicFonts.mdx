# Dynamic Fonts and Responsive Typography

In this guide, we’ll explore how to use dynamic fonts and responsive typography in web projects using MDX. This approach allows for interactive examples and live code components.

## Font Units
Fonts can be measured in various units. Understanding these units helps in creating responsive and flexible designs:

1. **Point (pt):** A traditional unit where 1 point equals 1/72 inch.
2. **Pixel (px):** A digital unit where each pixel represents a single point on a screen.
3. **Em:** A relative unit based on the font size of the parent element.
4. **Rem:** A relative unit based on the font size of the root element (`<html>`).
5. **Percentage (%):** Font size specified as a percentage of the parent element's font size.
6. **Viewport Width (vw):** A unit representing a percentage of the viewport width.
7. **Viewport Height (vh):** A unit representing a percentage of the viewport height.
8. **Inch (in):** A physical measurement, where 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters.
9. **Centimeter (cm):** A physical measurement, where 1 cm equals 10 millimeters.
10. **Millimeter (mm):** A smaller unit of measurement in the metric system.
11. **Pica (pc):** A traditional typographic unit, where 1 pica equals 12 points.

# Font Examples

This page demonstrates how different font sizes and units behave responsively based on the viewport width. Use these examples to understand how dynamic font sizes and units work in practice.

## Responsive Font Sizes

In the following example, font sizes change based on the viewport width:

import ResponsiveFontExample from '../codefiles/ResponsiveFontExample';

<ResponsiveFontExample />

## Font Units

Here are examples of various font units used in styling text:

import FontUnitsExample from '../codefiles/FontUnitsExample';

<FontUnitsExample />


## Dynamic Font Size

Creating responsive and adaptable font sizes ensures that text looks great on various devices. Here’s how to use `rem` units and media queries:

### Example: Responsive Font Sizes with `rem` Units

Create a file named `DynamicFontSize.module.css` with the following content:



## Conclusion

By using responsive design techniques and understanding different font units, you can create flexible and visually appealing typography for your web projects. Adjusting font sizes based on viewport width ensures that your text remains readable and aesthetically pleasing across different devices.
