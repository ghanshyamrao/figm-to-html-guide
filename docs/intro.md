# Figma to HTML Guide Intro

Converting Figma designs to HTML is a crucial step in bringing your designs to life on the web. By utilizing coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can recreate the visual elements and interactive components of your Figma designs. This process involves carefully analyzing the design, extracting assets, and coding the necessary HTML structure and styles to accurately represent the design. By converting Figma to HTML, you can create a functional and responsive website that matches the original design vision.
