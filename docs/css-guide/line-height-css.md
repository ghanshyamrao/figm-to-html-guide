# Line Height

Line height refers to the vertical space between lines of text. It plays an important role in the readability and aesthetics of your content. The ideal line height depends on various factors such as font size, font style, and the overall design of your layout.

## Understanding Line Height

Line height affects how text appears on the page. A well-chosen line height enhances readability by providing enough space between lines without causing text to appear too spaced out.

A general guideline is to set the line height to around 1.5 times the font size. For example, if your font size is 16 pixels, you can set the line height to 24 pixels.

### Basic Example

Here's an example of how to set the line height for a paragraph:

```css
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 24px;
}
